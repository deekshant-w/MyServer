## Hackathon Submission

### It helps you sort and share your files with others. 

Due to covid-19 our offline lectures have converteed to online meetings. Teachers can now share their screen but its often hard to share a lot of files of various types and sizes. MyServer is the sollution to this problem. Just open a file, set your server name, choose your directory and you are good to go online. It provides you with a publically shareable url which anyone can access to view your files. It automatically sorts your files into relevant categories and and lets you view media files without downloading them.
